        <h1>Accessible Content Matters</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our company's content accessibility guidelines. Accessibility is important for
            making sure everyone can engage with our materials effectively. </p>
        <h2>Content Guidelines </h2>
        <p>Making sure that our content meets high standards is critical. </p>
        <h2>Content Guidelines </h2>
        <p>Using proper structure makes navigation easier for all readers. Checks are to be done
            regularly. </p>
        <h2>Hashtags and Accessibility </h2>
        <p>When using hashtags, make sure they're formatted correctly. For example, writing
            #accessibilitymatters instead of #AccessibilityMatters can make it difficult for screen
            readers to interpret the text correctly. </p>
        <h2>Images and Alt-Text </h2>
        <p>Make sure all images have Alt text. Alt text should always be descriptive and end with a
            full stop.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="This is Alt text without a full stop" src="images/image2.jpg"
                style="width: 344.50px; height: 178.88px"/>
        </p>
